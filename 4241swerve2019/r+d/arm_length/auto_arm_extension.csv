Overall arm length at horizontal,,,28.25,(from pivot point of arm),,
,,,,,,Tune the values to the right as needed
Distance outside robot perimeter,,,28,,,
,,,,,,Basic strategy:
Total arm length at horizontal,,,56.25,,,1) Establish some working numbers for the arm length – the numbers are based on several assumptions:
,,,,,,a) Establish length of the arm that is inside the robot chassis – based on length of the chassis minus the pivot point distance
,,,,,,b) Set a limit of how far outside the chassis we are willing to go
,,,,,,c) Establish a total arm length
Arm angle,Arm Length,"Arm Extension Delta
(0 degree referenced)",Length delta from previous Degree Value,,,"2) Once we have the arm length, that becomes the bottom of our right triangle"
0,56.3,0.0,0,,,3) We calculate the height of the end of the arm at a specific angle by finding the tangent and multiplying it by the total length of the arm
1,56.3,0.0,0.0,,,"4) From that, we have the two perpendicular sides of a right triangle – we can solve for the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem"
2,56.3,0.0,0.0,,,5) We show both the total length of the arm at some angle as well as the delta from the arm at horizontal (the shortest position)
