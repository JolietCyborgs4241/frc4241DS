# Swerve Drive Encoder Replacement and Calibration

All this needs to be audited for correctness

## Removing the old encoder

From the top of the robot:

1) Remove any tie-wrap securing the encoder wire to the protection bracket (as needed)

1) Unplug the encoder cable - pull straight up - try to pull on the connector itself as much as possible and not on the wiring going into the connector


From the bottom of the robot:

1) Remove the roll pin securing the gear to the encoder shaft ( *HOW DO WE USUALLY DO THAT?  HAMMER AND PUNCH?  YIKES.  WE MIGHT WANT TO MAKE A TOOL.* )

1) Remove the gear from the encoder shaft

1) Remove the nut securing the encoder to the swerve drive mounting plate - take care to save any washers used to mount the encoder and note their order on the encoder mounting shaft

Back to the top side of the robot:

1) Remove the encoder from the top side of the robot by lifting it clear of its mounting hole

## Installing the new encoder


From the top of the robot:

1) Put a **small** drop of *BLUE* thread locker on the threaded encoder mounting part - use a **small** drop and don't let it get on the encoder shaft itself (the threaded part is brass colored and the shaft is silver - keep the thread locking compund away from the silver shaft as it could damage the encoder if it gets inside

1) Insert the encoder into its mounting hole

From the bottom of the robot:

1) Replace the nut securing the encoder to the swerve drive mounting plate - make sure you include any washers which were used to mount the damaged encoder

1) Snug the nut but be careful not to overtighten it  - snug is fine

1) Replace the gear on the encoder shaft - take care to line up the holes in the gear with the holes in the shaft - use a pin punch to help line them up and make sure that the punch can go all the way through before going further - if you have any trouble, remove the gear and turn the gear by 180 degress, replace it on the shaft, and try to realign the gear and shaft again

1) Insert the roll pin securing the gear to the encoder shaft ( *HOW DO WE USUALLY DO THAT?  HAMMER AND PUNCH?  YIKES.  WE MIGHT WANT TO MAKE A TOOL.* )

Back to the top side of the robot:

1) Plug in the encoder cable - push it straight in from the top making sure it is oriented correctly (it will only go in one way)

1) Use a tie-wrap to secure the encoder wire to the protection bracket (if the protection bracket is being used)

## Calibrating the new encoder

Step by step

* What we need to do to the robot

* What we need do do to the software

* How we interact with the robot to do the calibration

* How we can confirm the calibration is correct
