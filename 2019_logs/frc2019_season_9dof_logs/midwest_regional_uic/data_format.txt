Unless otherwise documented, this is the basic data format for the 9dof data:

Time (ms) - the sensor typically takes about 1400ms to start logging

Accelerometer (x, y, z)

Gyroscope (x, y, z) - rate of rotation

Magnetometer (x, y, z) - orientation; take this with a grain of salt, it's trying to determine orientation using the earth's magnetic field while being surrounded by motors and their associated magnetic fields

Quaternion (qw, qx, qy, qz)

Euler angle calculations (pitch, roll, yaw)

Heading (degrees?)
